# Explore US Bike Share Data
By: S. D. Boadi
Created on: September 2023

## Overview
In this project, we will utilize Python to investigate data concerning bike share systems in three prominent U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington.

All datasets were from [Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [New York](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).
The original files were significantly larger and less organized. To simplify the analysis and evaluation process, some data cleaning was carried out, resulting in the condensation of these files into six columns.
